I've been using Storybook at my current gig to mock up component / widget UI for a React app.

Storybook is a way to create components in isolation. From there you can import base styles and container properties to render the components in the app. You have a variety of tools at your disposal to:

- Build components in isolation using a variety of frameworks
- Make components interactive for feedback, and changes from your development team
- Test
  - Manual testing
  - Unit testing
  - Even visual testing (per pixel changes in the UI)
- Document components, features, properties, etc
- Use a variety of add-ons to enhance the Storybook app
- Deploy your Storybook app to a static site
- Use your Storybook as your app's style guide

I will most certainly be using Storybook for any serious app development going forward. Check out Storybook here: [https://storybook.js.org/](https://storybook.js.org/ "https://storybook.js.org/")
