Today I set up a website using [Gatsby Cloud and Contentful](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/contentful/getting-started/ "gatsby blouse and contentful").

The set up was pretty straight forward. You do have to clone the repo once generated and run yarn install then yarn run setup to add your contentful API keys and access tokens.

Github has been struggling this morning, so I think build time was a bit longer than it should be, but my gatsby site took 2:52 to build and 0:02 to deploy.

Building is only required with layout or major site additions. If you are just adding content like a blog post, or editing content that already exists like the author info on the homepage, a new build is not required. Pretty cool stuff!
