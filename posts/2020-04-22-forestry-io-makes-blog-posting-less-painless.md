I'm finding myself less likely to post on this blog when it's a site sitting in a repo waiting for me to add and build a markdown file.

[Forestry.io ](https://forestry.io "forestry")makes it easier for me to log on and type out some thoughts. It will then publish to the repo which builds on github pages and deploys (as long as it's on the master branch).

Today I spent a lot of time setting up example sites using Jekyll, Next.js, and Gatsby on services on forestry, and also [vercel.com](https://vercel.com "https://vercel.com") and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "netlify").

You can check out some of these examples in my repo list [here](https://github.com/leabs?tab=repositories "repo list").

Static sites seem to be the most secure and fastest option for websites, and frameworks like next.js have solved some of the [issues with static site drawbacks](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support "blog post on ssg").

Thanks for reading!
