I'm still alive. I have been working with a company on an IoT application. I've been learning React and Storybook and working with SCSS for their web app.

The holidays are upon us. Things for the year are slowing down. I have learned a lot in 2020, and while it was tough at times I feel I was able to grow as a person substantially.

Here is to hoping stresses and worries that are political or viral lighten up in 2021.
