I am very much the type of person to participate in new years resolutions. It is a good time to reflect on what I have done in the last year and also a good time to set goals for the coming year.

I want to build more things. I want to stop worrying about if my work flow is the most efficient and just focus on making stuff.

I have spent hours obsessing over what back up solution is best to save my work: Time machine vs rsync vs backblaze. Then I realized two things: I have never had to restore files and even if I did I have not really created anything worth backing up (that lives outside github), so why am I wasting my time?

I don’t want to think about making a blog, or comparing jekyll vs gatsby vs wordpress. I’m just typing out a post. I want to make a magic mirror, a new desk, build something with my hands out of pieces of wood or IoT dev kits or whatever. 2020 is the year I make more stuff.
