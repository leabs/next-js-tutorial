**The story so far...**

It has always been a dream of mine to be my own boss. I have had a lot of time since the pandemic hit and decided it might be the right time to take the plunge. Here is what I have done and learned so far:

1. I used the services at www.nolo.com to set up my LLC, and used them as a registered agent. The assist me with documents and setting up forms I need for the LLC. I could have saved a few dollars by doing it myself but I felt more comfortable having them involved. They also helped me with the business publication, which is a requirement in New York State.
2. Tax stuff so far has been a hassle. Since there is a pandemic going on I had to file for EIN online. I couldn't get it via online so I called the phone number only to find out that their call center is out of order. I had to wait until June to be able to call them (I filed with the state for the LLC in late April.)
3. I use Freshbooks for invoicing. They can generate invoices, track expenses, and do some account functions for me. It's a real intuitive process and they have apps which let me generate and send an invoice in seconds!

That's the story so far. I still have a long ways left on my journey and I am still learning things as I go. I've sent and received payment for a few jobs and it's felt great. I will update on this in a few months!
